# sequence

So here's the general idea.  I want to get better at writing vanilla Javascript and I really need practice with objects, scopes and closure.  So, I'm using the canvas element to create a sequence game.  I need some fun element to keep myself motivated.

## First Milestone | July 23rd

I've got it making a five shape sequence, now I've got to dig into the UI.  I would like to include different skill levels, but I'll probably have just one skill level to start since that would be the easiest.

-Update: Well, the UI is working and the app is up and running at Heroku.  I'll have to think overnight about any possible imporvements I could make.
